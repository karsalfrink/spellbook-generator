 # D&D Magic-User Spellbook Generator

A Python script for generating spellbooks for Magic-User characters in classic D&D. The generator supports multiple spell lists and handles character level and Intelligence modifier restrictions.

## Features

- Generate spellbooks based on character level (1-6)
- Account for Intelligence modifiers (-2 to +2)
- Support for multiple spell lists
- Combined spell selection from primary (2/3) and secondary (1/3) spell lists
- Automatic inclusion of Read Magic for all spellbooks
- Level-appropriate spell selection

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- CSV files containing spell lists

## Setup

1. Create a `spell-lists` directory in the same folder as the script:
```
your_folder/
    spellbook_generator.py
    spell-lists/
        your_spell_list1.csv
        your_spell_list2.csv
        etc.
```

2. Create your spell list CSV files. Each file should contain three lines, one for each spell level (1-3):
```csv
Magic Missile, Shield, Mage Armor, Detect Magic, Sleep, Charm Person
Mirror Image, Web, Levitate, Invisibility, Darkness
Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Fly, Haste, Dispel Magic
```

## Spell List Format

- Each CSV file represents a themed collection of spells
- Line 1: Level 1 spells (comma-separated)
- Line 2: Level 2 spells (comma-separated)
- Line 3: Level 3 spells (comma-separated)

## Character Level Restrictions

- Levels 1-2: Can only cast level 1 spells
- Levels 3-4: Can cast level 1-2 spells
- Levels 5-6: Can cast level 1-3 spells

## Intelligence Modifier Effects

The number of spells gained per level is calculated as:
- Base: 1 spell
- Modifier: Add Intelligence modifier (from -2 to +2)
- Minimum: 1 spell per level (even with negative modifiers)

## Usage

1. Run the script:
```bash
python spellbook_generator.py
```

2. Follow the prompts:
   - Select primary spell list (2/3 of spells will come from this)
   - Select secondary spell list (1/3 of spells will come from this)
   - Enter character level (1-6)
   - Enter Intelligence modifier (-2 to +2)

3. The generator will output a formatted spellbook:
```
1: Detect Magic, Magic Missile, Read Magic; 2: Mirror Image, Web; 3: Fireball.
```

## Notes

- Each spellbook automatically includes "Read Magic" as a level 1 spell
- Spells are selected randomly within level restrictions
- The script prevents duplicate spells in the same spellbook
- The format is designed for classic D&D-style games

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for:
- Missing spell-lists directory (will create if absent)
- Invalid character levels
- Invalid Intelligence modifiers
- Missing or malformed CSV files
- Invalid spell list selections
